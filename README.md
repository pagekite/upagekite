# upagekite: ESP32 / Pico W + MicroPython public web server

This code makes it very easy to create static web sites or simple web
services in MicroPython, and automatically punch through firewalls and
NAT to make the server reachable from the wider Internet.

This is a minimal HTTP server, web micro-framework and PageKite
implementation, written for use with MicroPython on the ESP32 or the
Raspberry Pi Pico W. It is also tested on Ubuntu/Python 3.7 and Ubuntu's
MicroPython snap. You will need access to a PageKite relay, such as
those provided by [pagekite.net](https://pagekite.net/).


**WARNING:** This code does not magically make the ESP32 or Pico W suitable
for hosting a high-volume webapp. Not does it "solve" security. Be careful!


## Hacking uHowTo

1. Clone upagekite: `git clone https://github.com/pagekite/upagekite/`
2. Follow the **Bootstrapping Development** guide below
3. Make changes to [stage_2.py](webapp/stage_2.py),
   the [webapp](webapp/webroot/),
   or [upagekite](upagekite/) itself.
4. Iterate!

Consult [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md) for guidance on how to
develop simple web apps or APIs using this framework.

Alternately, you may be better off exploring
[the Tutorial](https://github.com/pagekite/upagekite-tutorial/`).


## Project Status

### Works:

* Exposing a hello-world webapp via. [pagekite.net](https://pagekite.net/)
* Network-based bootstrapping, load & run code from the web
* Tested platforms and pythons:
   * MicroPython 1.19+ on the Raspberry Pi Pico W
   * MicroPython 1.19 on an ESP32-CAM module
   * MicroPython 1.14-1.19 on an ESP32-WROOM-32 DevKitC board
   * MicroPython 1.14 on Ubuntu Linux
   * Python 3.8.10 on Ubuntu Linux
* Adaptive relay selection (ESP32 and Pico W rely on DNS hints from web)
* Proxying to an external server (e2e TLS, SSH, ...)

### Not working yet:

* Relay TLS certificate verification

See our [Github Issues](https://github.com/pagekite/upagekite/issues/) for
details and a more complete list.


## Bootstrapping Development

### Before you start

You will probably need:

   * An ESP32 module or a Raspberry Pi Pico W
   * A proper USB cable
   * Credentials for your local WiFi
   * A [pagekite.net](https://pagekite.net/) account


### Local Python 3.x development

Take a look at the [hello.py](scripts/hello.py) sample script.

You can probably just run it:

    cd /path/to/upagekite
    python3 scripts/hello.py myname.pagekite.me mysecret

Since the sample app is written with the ESP32 in mind, some things may
not work. You can port over code from [webapp/stage_2.py](stage_2.py) into
[hello.py](scripts/hello.py) for fun and profit.


### Running on a live ESP32

There are many ways to upload code to your ESP32. Here we will describe
only one; using `picocom` to manage the serial link, and
`upagekite.esp32_install` to drive it.


#### 1. Verify that Linux sees your ESP32 as a serial device

Plug the ESP32 into your USB port, and then run `dmesg`:

    $ dmesg |grep -i usb |tail -5
    [...] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 57 using xhci_hcd
    [...] usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=1a86, idProduct=7523, ...
    [...] usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
    [...] usb 3-1: Product: USB2.0-Ser!
    [...] usb 3-1: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0

In this example, the ESP32 is connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

If nothing shows up, you probably need another cable. Or another ESP32.


#### 2. Make sure you can talk to MicroPython

If you haven't already flashed your
[ESP32 with MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html),
now is the time to do so!

Then `apt install picocom` and connect to your ESP32:

    $ picocom -b115200 --lower-dtr --lower-rts /dev/ttyUSB0
    ...
    MicroPython v1.14 [...] with ESP32
    Type "help()" for more information.
    >>>

You may want to try omitting the `--lower-dtr` and `--lower-rts`
arguments above; some boards need them, some don't. Omitting them is
preferable, since they reboot the board every time, but I haven't found
any other reliable way to connect to the ESP32-CAM. They are not needed
with the DevKit-C boards.
    

#### 3. Configure and upload code to the device

If you know your WiFi details and PageKite credentials, you may want to
set some enviroment variables first:

    $ export UPK_WIFI_SSID="yourwifi"
    $ export UPK_WIFI_KEY="wifiKey"
    $ export UPK_KITE_NAME="yourkitename.pagekite.me"
    $ export UPK_KITE_SECRET="verySecretSecret"

If you skip the above step, the default sample app should enable a captive
portal on the ESP32 which will let you input settings interactively, which
can be fun.

Next, run the install tool:

    $ python3 -m upagekite.esp32_install \
       |picocom -b115200 --lower-dtr --lower-rts /dev/ttyUSB0

    [... lots of output omitted ...]

Without any arguments, this will upload all of `upagekite` and all of
the sample app to the board's flash, in a folder named `bootstrap_live`.

The app should then run!

By default, the install tool scans the `upagekite/` and `webapp/`
folders for changed files and uploads anything new, configures WiFi and
PageKite credentials and launches the app. But it can do other things
too, see `pydoc3 upagekite.esp32_install` for details. 


#### 4. Commence hacking!

At this point, you will hopefully have made contact with your ESP32 and
launched a live webapp.

You can either hack on the sample app until it does what you want, or
explore [the Tutorial](https://github.com/pagekite/upagekite-tutorial/`)
for a more structured approach.


### Running on a live Raspberry Pi Pico W

The Pico W is so small, and so new, that it's hard to avoid building
custom MicroPython firmware for it. MicroPython 1.19 as released does not
include support for the board, but their Github repo does.

Here are [instructions on how to build upagekite-enabled MicroPython
for the Pico W](https://github.com/BjarniRunar/building-micropython/),
and [there should be binaries here](https://github.com/BjarniRunar/micropython-firmwares).

Once you have flashed the Pico W and it has rebooted, you should be able
to deploy code to the chip like so:

    $ python3 -m upagekite.esp32_install --nopk |picocom /dev/ttyACM0

(Consult the more complete ESP32 instructions above for hints about
environment variables and options.


## A Note About Resource Constraints

Uploading Python code to flash and compiling it on the ESP32 as described
above, is quite inefficient use of precious RAM.

Some features simply cannot work: for example, the sample webapp
disables TLS connections to the PageKite relays if a camera is detected.
There simply isn't enough RAM to compile all the code, manage the camera
and maintain an encrypted connection, all at once!

So once you have an idea what you want to develop, you will probably
want to build your own custom MicroPython firmware and "freeze" your
Python code (along with upagekite and any other dependencies) into the
binary. This allows MicroPython to run the bytecode directly from flash
and conserve RAM for use by your application.

This also unlocks the ability to use the ESP32's "native" OTA updates to
upgrade your code on running devices.
